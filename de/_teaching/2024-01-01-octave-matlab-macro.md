This PhD-level workshop provides a hands-on introduction to Octave/Matlab for applied macroeconomic research. I cover the fundamentals of numerical computing, matrix algebra, scripting, and workflow organization with a focus on typical macroeconomic applications. The course introduces **Dynare** as a standard tool for solving and simulating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, including model specification, steady-state computation, linearization, and impulse response analysis. Emphasis is placed on reproducible research practices and building a solid computational foundation for quantitative macroeconomic modeling.
