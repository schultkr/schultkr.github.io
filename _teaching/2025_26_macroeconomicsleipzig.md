In this course, I teach the core foundations of modern macroeconomics at the undergraduate level. The course introduces students to short-run and long-run macroeconomic analysis, covering topics such as aggregate demand and supply, business cycles, fiscal and monetary policy, economic growth, labor markets, inflation, and open-economy macroeconomics. A strong emphasis is placed on analytical reasoning, graphical intuition, and the application of standard models (e.g. IS–TR/LM, AS–AD, Solow growth model) to real-world economic issues and policy debates.
