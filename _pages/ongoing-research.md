## Ongoing Research

### KS + Rotemberg + Monetary Policy + Targeted Dividends — Model Documentation
**Status:** Work in progress  
**Summary:** This project documents a heterogeneous-agent Krusell–Smith (KS) model with Rotemberg price adjustment costs, a monetary policy rule that provides a nominal anchor, residual government spending to satisfy feasibility, and dividends targeted to top asset holders. The implementation is designed for an Auclert-style sequence-space toolkit: a household block solved by EGM (`HetBlock`), aggregate blocks implemented as `@simple` functions, and perfect-foresight transition paths solved with `td_solve`.
