I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH)** in the Department of Macroeconomics. My research combines dynamic macroeconomics and applied econometrics, with a specific focus on forecasting, energy markets, and the economic implications of climate change.

Research Interests
======
* **Macroeconomics:** business cycle dynamics and policy transmission.
* **Energy Economics:** price volatility and structural shifts in global energy markets.
* **Forecasting:** robust models for macroeconomic variables and energy indicators.
* **Climate Change:** impact of environmental policies on economic performance.

Current Projects
======
I am currently working on several third-funded research projects focused on large-scale macroeconomic forecasting and the integration of environmental and energy factors into economic models. My active work includes:

* **Energy Investments in Vietnam**: Developing and implementing macroeconomic models for the **GIZ** to support energy sector investments in the Vietnamese context.
* **Evaluation of InvKG & STARK**: Conducting a comprehensive evaluation for the **BMWK** on policy effectiveness and structural change in German coal regions.
